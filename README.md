## Leetcode Clone

This project is a Leetcode-Clone built using `React.js`, `NextJS`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind CSS` on the Frontend and `Firebase` as the Backend and deployed to Vercel.

I used `firebase-react-hooks` for authentication, `Firestore` for database and `runTransaction` to group multiple operations into a single transaction.

Also used `recoil` for managing global state, `react-icons` for icons, `react-youtube` for playing videos from youtube, `react-toastify` for displaying UI friendly alerts, `react-split` to create resizeable split views, `react-codemirror` for having an embedded code-editor environment, `assert` package for comparing the user's solution to right solution and `react-confetti` for congrats animation.
